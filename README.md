# Systems Analysis Course - Otto Group Product Classification Challenge

This repository contains all the work for the Systems Analysis & Design course, applying systems thinking, chaos theory, and quality frameworks to solve the Otto Group Product Classification Challenge.

## Project Overview

The Otto Group Product Classification Challenge involves building a robust classification system for e-commerce products. The project applies systems analysis principles to handle 200,000+ products with 93 obfuscated features across 9 categories, focusing on system stability, feedback mechanisms, and adaptive behavior.

## Repository Structure

### Workshops

This folder contains all workshop assignments following an incremental systems development approach:

- [Workshop 1](./workshops/workshop-1/) - System Analysis: Element identification, complexity analysis, and chaos theory application
- [Workshop 2](./workshops/workshop-2/) - System Design: Architecture definition, technical stack, and module integration
- [Workshop 3](./workshops/workshop-3/) - Quality & Risk Management: ISO/CMMI frameworks, Kanban methodology, and project planning
- [Workshop 4](./workshops/workshop-4/) - System Simulation: Behavioral validation, performance testing, and stability analysis

### Final Course Project

This folder contains the comprehensive final project integrating all workshop findings into a functional system prototype with modular architecture, documentation, and implementation guidelines.

## Systems Analysis Approach

The project applies key systems thinking principles:

- **Holistic Analysis**: Understanding component interactions and emergent behavior
- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Self-regulating loops for stability and adaptation
- **Chaos Theory**: Addressing sensitivity to initial conditions and parameter variations
- **Quality Frameworks**: ISO 9000, CMMI, and Six Sigma for process improvement
- **Modular Design**: Independent, interoperable components for scalability

## Technical Stack

- **Python**: Core development language
- **NumPy**: Numerical computation
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization and reporting
