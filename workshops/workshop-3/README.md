# Workshop 3 - Quality, Risk Management, and Project Planning

This folder contains the work for Workshop 3 of the Systems Analysis course, focusing on system robustness, quality frameworks, risk analysis, and project management planning.

## Objectives

- Refine system architecture for robustness and scalability
- Implement quality assurance frameworks (ISO 9000, CMMI, Six Sigma)
- Identify and mitigate system risks
- Define project management structure using Kanban methodology
- Plan incremental improvements and feedback mechanisms

## Updated Architecture

The architecture has been refined with:

- **Data Processing**: Validation scripts and consistency checks
- **Feature Engineering**: Fault-tolerant pipelines with retry mechanisms
- **Classification Engine**: Modular model loading and parallel training
- **Analytics and Reporting**: Performance dashboards and feedback systems
- **Monitoring and Logging Layer**: Runtime tracking and anomaly detection

## Quality Frameworks

- **ISO 9000**: Standardized quality assurance for data handling
- **CMMI**: Process maturity and repeatability guidelines
- **Six Sigma**: DMAIC principles for continuous improvement

## Risk Analysis

Identified risks and mitigation strategies:

1. **Data Loss or Corruption**: Git version control, automated validation, backups
2. **Model Overfitting**: Cross-validation, early stopping, calibration
3. **Pipeline Downtime**: Error recovery, automatic re-execution, alerts
4. **Security Breach**: Access control, encryption, credential management
5. **Performance Degradation**: Batch processing, parallel computation

## Project Management Plan

### Team Roles
- **Project Manager**: Jeison Cuenca - Oversees progress and communication
- **Analyst**: Juan Diego Lozada - Requirements and documentation
- **Developer**: Juan Pablo Mosquera - Code implementation and maintenance
- **Tester / Quality Engineer**: María Alejandra Ortiz - Validation and testing

### Methodology

Kanban-based approach with stages:
- To Do
- In Progress
- Review / Testing
- Done

### Benefits
- Enhanced visibility and accountability
- Continuous workflow
- Real-time adaptability
- Balanced workload

## Milestones

1. Workshop 1: System Analysis
2. Workshop 2: System Design
3. Workshop 3: Quality and Risk Management
4. Workshop 4: System Simulation
5. Final Project: Integration and delivery
