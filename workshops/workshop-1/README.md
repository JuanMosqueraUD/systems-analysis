# Workshop 1

This folder contains the work for Workshop 1 of the Systems Analysis course.

Otto Group is one of the largest e-Commerce companies in the world, having subsidiaries in more than 20 countries, including the USA with Crate & Barrel, Germany with Otto.de, and France with 3 Suisses. They sell millions of products worldwide every day, with several thousand products being added to their product line.

A consistent analysis of the performance of products is crucial. However, as a consequence of its diverse global infrastructure, many identical products are classified differently. Therefore, the quality of their product analysis depends on the ability to accurately cluster similar products. The better the classification, the more insight there can be generated about product range.
