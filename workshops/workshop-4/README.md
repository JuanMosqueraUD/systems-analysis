# Workshop 4 - System Simulation and Validation

This folder contains the work for Workshop 4 of the Systems Analysis course, focusing on system simulation, behavioral validation, and performance testing.

## Objectives

- Develop data-driven simulations to validate system behavior
- Implement event-based simulations for component interaction
- Test performance stability under varying conditions
- Validate feedback mechanisms and adaptive responses
- Measure sensitivity to parameter variations
- Ensure system readiness for final integration

## Simulation Types

### Data-Driven Simulation
- Validates data processing pipeline with synthetic and real datasets
- Tests feature engineering transformations
- Evaluates classification engine performance
- Measures end-to-end processing time

### Event-Based Simulation
- Simulates component interactions and message passing
- Tests error recovery and retry mechanisms
- Validates monitoring and logging functionality
- Evaluates feedback loop effectiveness

## Validation Criteria

- **Stability**: Consistent results under equivalent configurations
- **Performance**: Processing time within acceptable limits
- **Accuracy**: Model predictions meet quality thresholds
- **Robustness**: Graceful handling of errors and edge cases
- **Scalability**: Performance maintained with larger datasets

## Testing Scenarios

1. Normal operation with complete data
2. Missing or corrupted data handling
3. Extreme parameter values
4. High-volume data processing
5. Concurrent component execution
6. Recovery from failures
